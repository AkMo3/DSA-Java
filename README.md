### DSA- Java
  1. This Is A Repositry that is meant to contain all new Data Structures And Algorithms of Java along with other codes like of Crytography, Dynamic Programming, and some medium-large size codes also like of Andoid Development.
  2. Codes are divided into different folders according to their classification like Algorithms, search, datastructure.
### Usage 
  1. Import package by
     `import {DIRECTORY_TYPE}.{FOLDER_NAME}.{FILE_NAME}.{CLASS_NAME};`  
     Example :- `import algorithms.search.BinarySearch.BinarySearcher;`  
  2. Create instance of class by 
     `{CLASS_NAME}<> {IDENTIFIER_OF_YOUR_CHOICE} = new {CLASS_NAME}<>({PARAMETER_IF_ANY});`  
     Example :- `BinarySearcher<Integer> bs = new BinarySearcher<Integer>(a);`  
  3. Use functions of class by `{IDENTIFIER}.{FUNCTION_OF_CLASS}({PARAMETER_IF_ANY});`  
      Example :- `return bs.search(23);`
  4. Found issue : Please inform us by making a new Issue in [Issues](https://github.com/AkMo3/DSA-Java/issues).
      
  NOTE:- Usually in this project, actual class name may `{FILE_NAME}+"er"`. Example- The actual Binary Search class name will be `{BinarySearch}+"er"` i.e. `BinarySearcher`
  
  ### Contribution Guide :octocat:
  
  First, we would congratulate you for joining our community:wave:. A warm welcome from our side:tada:. We look forward to your jounery with us. :boom:
  
  First some ground rules :
   1. If making a PR for a existing issue commit message should be `Fixes: #{ISSUE_NO}`.
   2. If Issue doesn't exist add want to add a new featuer or change, make a Issue first and follow rule **1**.
   3. Complete the PR templete and fill required feilds, otherwise PR may not be considered.
   4. PR should pass all the automated test.
   5. The main working class should be `{FILE_NAME}er`. Read Usage Note for better understanding. While this may not always be possible.
   6. Code should be Generic if a algorithm or Data Structure.
